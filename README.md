# Books store

A small test task, which is an emulation of a bookstore. The application displays a list of books, it is possible to add books, change information about the book, view information about the book. This application does not use a backend, all information is stored in an array and will be lost when the page or application is reloaded.



This application uses the following frameworks and libraries:

1. Next.js
2. 

This example shows how to integrate Next.js with [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org).

The **Redux Toolkit** is a standardized way to write Redux logic (create actions and reducers, setup the store with some default middlewares like redux devtools extension). This example demonstrates each of these features with Next.js

```bash
npx create-next-app --example with-redux with-redux-app
```

```bash
yarn create next-app --example with-redux with-redux-app
```

```bash
pnpm create next-app --example with-redux with-redux-app
```
